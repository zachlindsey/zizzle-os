# zizzle-os

I was looking for a tutorial for writing a simple OS on the raspberry pi 4 that also tried to have you learn some assembly along the way, and it seemed like all the existing tutorials were for earlier models of the pi or were mostly written in C or had little exposition about what was going on in the code. So, I decided to recombine several of these tutorials to form what I wanted. You should be warned that I'm mostly writing this as I'm learning about the stuff for the first time, so it's almost certain that most things are not implemented correctly or completely. 

## who this tutorial is for

I'm assuming that if you're reading this, you...

* want to make a simple OS on the raspberry pi 4
* want to learn some assembly in writing this os
* know a little bit about programming already
